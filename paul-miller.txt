Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?  a block level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.  The inline does not take up a full line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?  It no longer exists in the normal document layout flow.  It will be in its own layer, separate from everything else.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?  Use a CSS declaration.
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.  1. block default elements, <div>, <header>, & <footer>.   2. Inline elements, <img> & <span>.  3. inline-block, <button>  
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?  I don't know how to explain this.
